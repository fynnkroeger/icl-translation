kinds of tokens:
- instruction
- ex_source
- joiner
- ex_target
- seperator (consider end of sentence too)
- instruction
^-- always the same so we can annotate once 
- source
- target (output)
- INST

uninteresting patterns
- self, previous, first attention
- within target
- within examples

interesting patterns
- direct flow from ex to target
- ex to summary
- summary to target
- source to target
- between summary tokens
